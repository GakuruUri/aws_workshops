# AWS 101 Workshop

### This is a hands-on project that can be done by anyone even with no experience using Amazon Web Services.

#### By doing this project, one learns core service including
> VirtualNetworks, Security Groups, compute instances, load balancing and storage.

This project covers the fundamental building blocks needed to run a scalable, secure web application on AWS.

```
We'll start by configuring the network environment, then deploy the web server, set up access controls, and integrate cloud storage. Finally, we'll test the end-to-end functionality of the web application and do a clean-up.
```

## Building a website

```
The goal is to ensure you develop a solid understanding of these fundamental AWS concepts and services. While there may be more efficient ways to host a website on AWS, we're walking through this approach as it's a great way to learn the core building blocks.

Let's get started building your first AWS-powered web application! We'll begin by setting up the network that will host your infrastructure.
```

## Virtual Private Cloud (Networking)

```
An Amazon VPC is a logically isolated virtual network that you define, allowing you to launch AWS resources in a secure, isolated environment. You can use the VPC wizard to set up networking for the web server which include subnets, routing etc
